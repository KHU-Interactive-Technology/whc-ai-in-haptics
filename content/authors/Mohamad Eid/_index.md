### EEG and AI for Enabling Cognitive Haptic Interaction

Neurohaptics has been on the rise as an alternative method for the evaluation of haptic experience. This method is based on capturing the neural traces exhibited in response to a haptic stimulation and automatically decoding it using trained AI models. Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a direct view into rapid neural dynamics through its high temporal resolution and cost-effectiveness compared to other brain imaging methods. In this talk, I will present a methodology for enabling cognitive assessment of the haptic experience using EEG data and deep learning models. The methodology will be demonstrated through multiple haptic experiences, including fingertip vibration feedback, upper-body vibration feedback, and fingertip thermal feedback. I will also discuss challenges/limitations of the proposed approach, as well as perspectives for future work.
