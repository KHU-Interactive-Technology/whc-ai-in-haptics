### Estimating Contact Force from Capacitive Sensor Data 
<br>
We introduce a new contract force estimation approach using capacitive sensors. The operation principle of this novel sensing technique is based on the charactoristics of mutual capacitance touch screens. Due to the deformation of contact body parts, capactive images are generally enlarged as the force increases. Interestingly, we obsearve that capacitive sensor values at the centroid of the capacitive images decrease after tightly coupled to capacitive sensors.
